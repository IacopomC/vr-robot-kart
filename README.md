## Running

1. Load [OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) into SD card of the RPi
2. Connect RPi to the robot (USB) and camera (camera module port)
3. Load [`robot.ino`](src/robot.ino) into the arduino
4. Run [`driving.py`](src/driving.py) and [`stream.sh`](src/stream.sh) in the RPi (don't forget to change to your IP)
5. Run VR project in Unity
